📘 L1 — Encapsulation and Polymorphism
⏱ Suggested time: 40 minutes

#	Type	Marks	Question
1.1	Theory	5	What is encapsulation? Explain how Java achieves it using access modifiers and getter/setter methods. Give one real-life analogy.
1.2	Theory	5	What is polymorphism? Distinguish compile-time (static) vs run-time (dynamic) polymorphism with one example each.
1.3	Practical	10	Write a BankAccount class demonstrating encapsulation (private balance + getBalance()/deposit()) and polymorphism (overloaded deposit(double) / deposit(double, String remarks)). Include a Main class calling both overloads.

📘 L2 — Method Overloading vs Overriding (Early vs Late Binding)
⏱ Suggested time: 40 minutes

#	Type	Marks	Question
2.1	Theory	5	Compare overloading vs overriding: definition, class involved, parameters, return type, binding time.
2.2	Theory	5	Explain early binding vs late binding. Why is overriding resolved at run time and overloading at compile time?
2.3	Practical	10	Shape with area(), overridden by Circle and Rectangle (late binding via Shape reference). Add overloaded describe(String) / describe(String, int) in Shape (early binding). Show sample output.

📘 L3 — Abstract Class vs Interface
⏱ Suggested time: 40 minutes

#	Type	Marks	Question
3.1	Theory	5	Define abstract class & interface. List ≥4 structural differences (fields, constructors, method bodies, multiple inheritance).
3.2	Theory	5	When should you choose an abstract class vs an interface? Give two real-world scenarios ("is-a" with shared code vs "can-do" capability).
3.3	Practical	10	Vehicle (abstract, startEngine() implemented + abstract fuelType()) and Insurable (interface, calculatePremium()). Car extends Vehicle and implements Insurable. Comment on why each construct was chosen.

📘 L4 — Collection Framework
⏱ Suggested time: 40 minutes

#	Type	Marks	Question
4.1	Theory	5	Compare ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList: underlying structure, synchronization, insert/delete vs random-access performance.
4.2	Theory	5	Explain Set and its implementations HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet. How does TreeSet maintain order?
4.3	Practical	10	Store 5 student names in an ArrayList (print with enhanced for-loop) and in a TreeSet (print, observe sorting). Comment on ordering difference.

📘 L5 — Multithreading & Custom Exception Handling
⏱ Suggested time: 40 minutes

#	Type	Marks	Question
5.1	Theory	5	List ≥3 ways to implement multithreading in Java (extends Thread, implements Runnable, ExecutorService/Callable). Which is preferred and why?
5.2	Practical	5	Two threads printing 1–5 concurrently — one via extends Thread, one via implements Runnable. Show how both are started from main().
5.3	Practical	10	Custom checked exception InvalidRadiusException. Circle constructor throws it if radius < 0. Main reads radius, handles via try-catch, else prints area.

📘 L6 — JDBC with MySQL/Oracle (MVC Pattern)
⏱ Suggested time: 40 minutes

#	Type	Marks	Question
6.1	Theory	5	Steps to connect Java to MySQL/Oracle via JDBC. Name key classes (DriverManager, Connection, PreparedStatement, ResultSet).
6.2	Theory	5	Explain the MVC pattern and how a JDBC app's classes map to Model/View/Controller.
6.3	Practical	10	MVC-style code for Student: Model (Student), Controller/DAO (StudentDAO.insert() using PreparedStatement), View (Main) collecting input and calling the controller.

📘 L7 — JavaFX — House Loan Calculator
⏱ Suggested time: 40 minutes

#	Type	Marks	Question
7.1	Theory	5	Explain the JavaFX application structure (Application, Stage, Scene, GridPane/VBox). Role of start()?
7.2	Practical	10	Design the GridPane layout: Loan Amount, Annual Rate, Number of Years inputs + "Calculate" button + result labels.
7.3	Practical	5	Event handler computing Monthly Installment (amortization formula), Total Payment, and Difference (Total Payment − Loan Amount).

📘 L8 — Socket Programming & Java RMI (Chat System)
⏱ Suggested time: 40 minutes

#	Type	Marks	Question
8.1	Theory	5	Compare Socket programming vs Java RMI. When to prefer each?
8.2	Practical	8	Server code using ServerSocket: accept connection, read via BufferedReader, reply via PrintWriter.
8.3	Practical	7	Client code using Socket: connect to server, send typed message, print server reply.

📘 L9 — Servlet + JSP + JDBC CRUD (Student Records)
⏱ Suggested time: 40 minutes

#	Type	Marks	Question
9.1	Theory	5	Steps to set up student_db / Students table project with Servlet + JSP + JDBC (DB setup, mapping, connection string).
9.2	Practical	8	Servlet doPost(): read ID/Name/CGPA from form, insert via PreparedStatement, with exception handling.
9.3	Practical	7	JSP page: connect to student_db, SELECT from Students, display as HTML table.
📐 Reference UML — Servlet/JSP MVC request flow
📘 L10 — Spring Boot REST API with JPA/ORM
⏱ Suggested time: 40 minutes

#	Type	Marks	Question
10.1	Theory	5	Steps to set up Spring Boot + REST + JPA (Maven deps: spring-boot-starter-web, spring-boot-starter-data-jpa, MySQL connector) and role of embedded Tomcat.
10.2	Practical	8	JPA Student entity (id, name, cgpa) + StudentRepository extends JpaRepository.
10.3	Practical	7	@RestController with GET /students and POST /students endpoints using the repository.
📐 Reference UML — Spring Boot layered architecture
📘 L11 — Servlet CRUD — District Quiz Game
⏱ Suggested time: 40 minutes

#	Type	Marks	Question
11.1	Theory	5	Design DB schema for quiz on Crops / Geography / Academic Institutions of your district + Player/Score table. Justify design.
11.2	Practical	8	Servlet method: save Player name + final score into PlayerScore via JDBC/PreparedStatement.
11.3	Practical	7	Quiz logic: ≥3 MCQs (crop, geography, institution) as objects; present, check answer, increment score.

📘 L12 — GoF Design Patterns
⏱ Suggested time: 40 minutes

#	Type	Marks	Question
12.1	Theory	6	List all 5 GoF Creational patterns (Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype) with one-line purpose each.
12.2	Theory	7	List all 7 GoF Structural patterns (Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy) with one-line purpose each.
